# Scrimba React Travel Journal

This project is a travel journal (with details such as location, image, description, google maps link...) built from scratch as part of the [Scrimba's Learn React course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e).
It receives the data from a separate file and uses `props` to pass the data to the Card components. Then it uses .map to loop through the data and render each card.
